# scripts
Various scripts for deployment, etc.

```
deploy-tar.sh             == Configurable script to deploy the contents of a tarball to Apache2
deploy-tar-daemon.sh      == Same as above but watches for /tmp.site, add the cronjob in the TXT file
cross-compiler-install.sh == Install GCC/Binutils, pass it the architecture
compton-toggle.sh         == Toggle compton compositor (I map it to ALT+SHIFT+F12 like KDE since I use XFCE)
xbacklight.sh             == Assign to hotkeys if ACPI is broken for your screen dimming.
backup-system.sh          == Script I wrote to backup my system, files in backup-system.includes are rsynced
decrypt-backup-drive.sh   == Exactly what it says
tar-filesystem.sh         == Modified script from ArchWiki to backup my system minus /home
unmount-backup-drive.sh   == Excactly what it says
```
